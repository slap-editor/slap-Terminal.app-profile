# [slap](https://github.com/slap-editor/slap) Terminal.app profile

Profile for Terminal.app which supports more keybindings

## For mouse support

* [SIMBL](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php)
* [MouseTerm](https://bitheap.org/mouseterm/) plugin for SIMBL

## Added keybindings

```
S-up = "\033[1;2A"
S-down = "\033[1;2B"
C-S-up = "\033[1;6A"
C-S-down = "\033[1;6B"
C-S-right = "\033[1;6C"
C-S-left = "\033[1;6D"
M-S-up = "\033[1;10A"
M-S-down = "\033[1;10B"
M-S-right = "\033[1;10C"
M-S-left = "\033[1;10D"
```

The following were added even though they don't work.

```
S-home = "\033[1;2H"
S-end = "\033[1;2F"
M-backspace = "\033 "
```

## Opinionated defaults

* Tango Dark color scheme
* Monaco 12 pt. font
